Job Description:
about Us- Cloudflare
position- Systems Engineer - Logs

At Cloudflare, we have our eyes set on an ambitious goal: to help build a better Internet. Today the company runs one of the world’s largest networks that powers approximately 25 million Internet properties, for customers ranging from individual bloggers to SMBs to Fortune 500 companies. Cloudflare protects and accelerates any Internet application online without adding hardware, installing software, or changing a line of code. Internet properties powered by Cloudflare all have web traffic routed through its intelligent global network, which gets smarter with every request. As a result, they see significant improvement in performance and a decrease in spam and other attacks. Cloudflare was named to Entrepreneur Magazine’s Top Company Cultures list and ranked among the World’s Most Innovative Companies by Fast Company.

We realize people do not fit into neat boxes. We are looking for curious and empathetic individuals who are committed to developing themselves and learning new skills, and we are ready to help you do that. We cannot complete our mission without building a diverse and inclusive team. We hire the best people based on an evaluation of their potential and support them throughout their time at Cloudflare. Come join us!

You will work as part of our core engineering team which builds the Cloudflare system running in 160+ cities around the world. Your work will focus on building robust, secure and high performance distributed systems. We are a small engineering team operating at a massive scale, so what you do will have a huge influence. We work in agile teams, so you will be supported by colleagues, and collaborate with other teams around the company.

On the Logs team, you would be responsible for crafting, building, and scaling one of the biggest global data pipelines to overcome network delays and partitions to deliver Cloudflare logs to customers in a timely manner. We are using Go, Kafka, ClickHouse, GraphQL and PostgreSQL to store and analyze in excess of 25 million events per second (and growing fast). A huge plus if you are interested in working with the entire stack from frontend to backend.

If you joined us, your first 6 months could look like this: You start with a structured onboarding during which you get up-to-speed with the systems that move data around Cloudflare. You lead a project which uses our firehose of over 25 million events per second to help improve systems which collect, buffer, and deliver logs to customers’ destinations. You will help build new systems that provide customers with the ability to search, filter and analyze logs from Cloudflare systems. You share the knowledge gained with your colleagues. You take ownership of these systems, ensuring that they are secure, scalable, robust, and observable. You talk about this work at one of our weekly company talks, put together a post for the company blog, and engage with engineers on other teams who have exciting ideas about a way to take the work further.


Resume:

About me: 
I am a Ph.D. Candidate at SIS@UNC Charlotte, and My advisor is Dr. Jinpeng Wei. I am working as both Research and Teaching Assistant at UNC Charlotte. As a Research Assistant, I worked on projects funded by DOE and ONR. My research aims at developing distributed security analytics for distributed threat hunting. I developed distributed hierarchical event monitoring system to detect attacks based on attack technique description (static and behavioral features) provided by the MITRE ATT&CK framework. It aims at delivering monitoring intrusiveness, reducing communication overhead among agents, and enabling local decision-making while maintaining attacks and attack techniques detection accuracy high and in time. For low-level log (Windows ETW) analysis, I used provenance graph analysis, Bayesian network, NLP, and Deep learning. I have hands-on experience with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, ElasticSearch, and RabbitMQ.
As a Teaching Assistant, I teach, design, and prepare graduate courses-"Principles of Information Security and Privacy, Network Infrastructure Security, Data mining, course assignments, and exam questions.
Before joining UNC Charlotte as a Ph.D. student, I worked as a Software Engineer and Team Lead at Kona Software Lab Ltd., Dhaka, Bangladesh, with industry experience in core J2EE, NFC, PKI Systems, CA, and chip-based smart card technologies. My responsibility as a software engineer was to design and develop middleware libraries for PKI and CA systems while conforming to KISA , FIPS, PKCS#7, and PKCS#11 standards. I lead a team of three software developers to design and develop NFC-based smart card authentication for Windows OS.
