Resume:

About me: 
I am a Ph.D. Candidate at SIS@UNC Charlotte, and My advisor is Dr. Jinpeng Wei. I am working as both Research and Teaching Assistant at UNC Charlotte. As a Research Assistant, I worked on projects funded by DOE and ONR. My research aims at developing distributed security analytics for distributed threat hunting. I developed distributed hierarchical event monitoring system to detect attacks based on attack technique description (static and behavioral features) provided by the MITRE ATT&CK framework. It aims at delivering monitoring intrusiveness, reducing communication overhead among agents, and enabling local decision-making while maintaining attacks and attack techniques detection accuracy high and in time. For low-level log (Windows ETW) analysis, I used provenance graph analysis, Bayesian network, NLP, and Deep learning. I have hands-on experience with the MITRE ATT&CK framework, ElasticSearch, and RabbitMQ.
As a Teaching Assistant, I teach, design, and prepare graduate courses-"Principles of Information Security and Privacy, Network Infrastructure Security, Data mining, course assignments, and exam questions.
Before joining UNC Charlotte as a Ph.D. student, I worked as a Software Engineer and Team Lead at Kona Software Lab Ltd., Dhaka, Bangladesh, with industry experience in core J2EE, NFC, PKI Systems, CA, and chip-based smart card technologies. My responsibility as a software engineer was to design and develop middleware libraries for PKI and CA systems while conforming to KISA , FIPS, PKCS#7, and PKCS#11 standards. I lead a team of three software developers to design and develop NFC-based smart card authentication for Windows OS.
