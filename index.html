    I am a Ph.D. Candidate at <a href="https://cci.uncc.edu/departments/software-and-information-systems-sis">SIS@UNC Charlotte</a>.
    My research aims at developing security analytics for distributed threat hunting. I developed distributed
    hierarchical event monitoring system to detect attacks based on attack technique description (static and behavioral features)
    provided by the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">MITRE ATT&CK framework</a>. For low-level log (Windows ETW) analysis, I used provenance graph analysis, Bayesian network, NLP, and Deep learning.

<p style="text-align: justify"> 
    Another goal of my research is to determine what to measure (observables), how to measure (tools required), and metrics to assess the enforcement of CISâ€™s critical security 
	controls. I used prompt engineering techniques (Zero-shot learning, Few-shot learning, Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-though) with LLM (ChatGPT, LLAMA) 
	to extract that information from the CIS CSC guidelines. I have hands-on experience with the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">MITRE ATT&CK framework</a>, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch-graph">ElasticSearch</a>, and <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>.

    As a Teaching Assistant, I teach, design, and prepare graduate courses-"<a href="https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=19&coid=61003">Principles of Information Security and Privacy,
    <a href="https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=19&coid=61045">Network Infrastructure Security</a>,
    <a href="https://catalog.charlotte.edu/preview_course_nopop.php?catoid=19&coid=58985">Data mining</a>, course assignments, and exam questions.

    Before joining UNC Charlotte as a Ph.D. student, I worked as a Software Engineer and Team Lead at <a href="https://konasl.com/">Kona Software Lab Ltd., Dhaka, Bangladesh</a>,
    with industry experience in core J2EE, NFC, PKI Systems, CA, and chip-based smart card technologies. My responsibility as a software engineer
    was to design and develop middleware libraries for PKI and CA systems. I led a team of three software developers to design and develop NFC-based smart card authentication for
    Windows OS.
