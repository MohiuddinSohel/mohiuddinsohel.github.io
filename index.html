    I am a Ph.D. Candidate at <a href="https://cci.uncc.edu/departments/software-and-information-systems-sis">SIS@UNC Charlotte</a>. I am working as both
    Research and Teaching Assistant at UNC Charlotte. As a Research Assistant, I worked on projects funded by DOE and ONR.
    My research aims at developing distributed security analytics for distributed threat hunting. I developed distributed
    hierarchical event monitoring system to detect attacks based on attack technique description (static and behavioral features)
    provided by the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">MITRE ATT&CK framework</a>. It aims at delivering monitoring intrusiveness, reducing communication overhead among agents,
    and enabling local decision-making while maintaining attacks and attack techniques detection accuracy high and in time.
    For low-level log (Windows ETW) analysis, I used provenance graph analysis, Bayesian network, NLP, and Deep learning.
    I have hands-on experience with the <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">MITRE ATT&CK framework</a>, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch-graph">ElasticSearch</a>, and <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a>.

    Before joining UNC Charlotte as a Ph.D. student, I worked as a Software Engineer and Team Lead at <a href="https://konasl.com/">Kona Software Lab Ltd., Dhaka, Bangladesh</a>,
    with industry experience in core J2EE, NFC, PKI Systems, CA, and chip-based smart card technologies. My responsibility as a software engineer
    was to design and develop middleware libraries for PKI and CA systems while conforming to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_Internet_%26_Security_Agency">KISA</a>
    , <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standards">FIPS</a>, <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2315">PKCS#7</a>, and
    <a href="http://www.cryptsoft.com/pkcs11doc/v220/">PKCS#11</a> standards. I lead a team of three software developers to design and develop NFC-based smart card authentication for
    Windows OS.
