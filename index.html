    My research endeavor centered around developing Security Analytics for Distributed Threat Hunting and Critical Security Control Enforcement Assessment. I developed a hierarchical event monitoring system for distributed threat hunting using low-level log (Windows ETW) Analysis, Provenance Graph Analysis, Bayesian network, NLP, and Deep learning techniques. </p>
<p style="text-align: justify"> 
    Another goal of my research is to determine what to measure (observables), how to measure (tools required), and metrics to assess the enforcement of CISâ€™s critical security 
	controls. I used prompt engineering techniques (Few-shot learning, Chain-of-Thought, Tree-of-Though) with LLM (ChatGPT, LLAMA) 
	to extract that information from the CIS CSC guidelines. I extensively used <a href="https://attack.mitre.org/">MITRE ATT&CK framework</a>, <a href="https://www.elastic.co/what-is/elasticsearch-graph">ElasticSearch</a>, and <a href="https://www.rabbitmq.com/">RabbitMQ</a> in my work.

    Prior to starting my Ph.D. at UNC Charlotte, I worked at <a href="https://konasl.com/">Kona Software Lab Ltd., Dhaka, Bangladesh</a> as a Software Engineer and Team Lead. During my time there, I gained valuable experience in core J2EE, NFC, PKI Systems, CA, and chip-based smart card technologies. My primary responsibility was to design and develop middleware libraries for PKI and CA systems. Additionally, I led a team of three software developers in designing and developing NFC-based smart card authentication for Windows OS.

<p style="text-align: justify">
    I earned my Ph.D. in Computing and Information Systems from <a href="https://www.charlotte.edu/">UNC Charlotte</a> in March 2024.
