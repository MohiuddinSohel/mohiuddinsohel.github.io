<b>Welcome to My Personal Homepage</b> <br> <br>

My research aims at developing distributed hierarchical event monitoring system to detect attacks based on attack technique
description (static and behavioral features) provided by the MITRE ATT&CK framework. It aims at providing monitoring intrusiveness,
reducing communication overhead among agents, and enabling local decision-making while maintaining attacks and attack techniques
detection accuracy high and in time. I mainly apply methodologies such as NLP, Bayesian Network, Formal Modeling, Machine Learning,
Deep Learning, and others. I am also interested in developing large-scale software based on my research.
