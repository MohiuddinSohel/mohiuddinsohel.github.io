**AUTO-Hunter** [August 2020 - till date] <br>, Distributed Hierarchical Event Monitoring System for Attack Diagnosis through Active Investigation of Attacker Activities. Designed and implemented distributed hierarchical event monitoring system to reduce attack detection time, communication overhead and resource usages. Designed and developed low-level log collecting agents for windows system (ETW, event logs, syslog, NetFlow). Developed detectors to map low-level traces to MITRE ATT\&CK technique and evidential reasoing framework which performs passive reasoning and active investigation on reported observables.
- Development Language: Python, Java.<br>

**Critical Security Control (CSC) Validation** [August 2018 - May 2020],  Automated extraction of threat action, observables, and development of  key measurement indicators (KMI) and metrics for KMI of each CSC.
- Development Language: Python, Java.<br>
    
**TTPDrill** [January 2017 - July 2018],  Automatic and Accurate Extraction of Threat Actions from Unstructured Text of CTI Sources and mapping of threat actions to  MITRE ATT\&CK techniques. Extracted threat action from CTI reports using NLP and mapped the extracted threat actions to MITRE ATT\&CK techniques and tactics using document similarity measures TF-IDF.
    - Development Language: Java.<br>

**PKI-Middleware** [May 2014 - December 2015], a [PKCS#11](http://www.cryptsoft.com/pkcs11doc/v220/) dynamic library developed for Windows, Linux, MAC and Android platform which complies [KISA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korea_Internet_%26_Security_Agency) and [FIPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Information_Processing_Standards) standards. Implemented Multithreading and Multiprocessing, Smart Card Profile Initialization, key operation (RSA key, Secret key (DES3, AES, MAC, SEED) and Random Number Generation), and sign operation (Signature generation and verification, Symmetric and Asymmetric key encryption and decryption, MAC Generation and verification).
   - Development Language: C++, JNI.<br>

     **Custom CSP** [January 2016 - April 2016]<br>, *Cryptographic Service Provider* is a MSDN Compatible library that implements the Microsoft's CryptoAPI [(CAPI)](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa380239).
    - Development Language: C++, Windows API. <br>
    
    **CMS**,  [May2015 - June 2015] <br> (Cryptographic Message Syntax)}, a [PKCS#7](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2315) based toolkit developed to support [CA System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Certificate_authority) during certificate Issue that supports all data types (*Signed, Enveloped, SignedAndEnveloped, data*) of [PKCS#7](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2315) and their operations.
    - Development Language: Java.<b>
        
    **PKI-Middleware Wrapper**, [January 2015 - March 2015] is a Java wrapper to use [PKCS#11](http://www.cryptsoft.com/pkcs11doc/v220/) middleware library in Java Application. It reduces maintenance  complexity of *JNI*, so that application developer  don't have to write core C code to handle function call of [PKCS#11](http://www.cryptsoft.com/pkcs11doc/v220/) library.
    - Development Language: Java.<br>
