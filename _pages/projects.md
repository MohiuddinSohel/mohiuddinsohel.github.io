<b>AUTO-Hunter</b> [August 2020 - till date], Distributed Hierarchical Event Monitoring System for Attack Diagnosis through Active 
Investigation of Attacker Activities. Designed and implemented distributed hierarchical event monitoring system to reduce attack
 detection time, communication overhead and resource usages. Designed and developed low-level log collecting agents for windows 
 system (ETW, event logs, syslog, NetFlow). Developed detectors to map low-level traces to MITRE ATT\&CK technique and evidential 
 reasoing framework which performs passive reasoning and active investigation on reported observables.
